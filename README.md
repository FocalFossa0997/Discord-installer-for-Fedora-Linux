# Discord-installer-for-Fedora-Linux
A Discord installer for Fedora Linux
***Note: You will need to run DownloadLatest.py before you can install it***
# Known problems
>The application icon appears as the default icon or invisible  
>The application thinks the install is corrupt  
>You can't use the installer to update discord once it has been installed. You have to manually uninstall it, download the latest **discord.tar.gz** file and then reinstall using that new file  
# Future plans
> I am thinking of adding an easier way to update discord after it has been installed. The only way to do that currently is to uninstall discord, rerun **DownloadLatest.py**, then reinstall it using the new and updated **discord.tar.gz** file.
